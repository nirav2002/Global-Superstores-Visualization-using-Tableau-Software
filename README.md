The project focuses on analyzing data for a hypothetical global store using Tableau Software, aiming to uncover valuable insights and support data-driven decision-making. The primary objective is to leverage Tableau's powerful visualization capabilities to interpret complex datasets and present them in an intuitive and actionable manner.

The analysis begins with an exploration of Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) acorss various product markets, segmented by different geographical regions such as North America, APAC, and EMEA. This helps identify the highest-value markets and tailor marketing strategies accordingly. Additionally, a Sales by Product Market analysis uses pie charts to show the distribution of sales across regions, quickly highlighting each market's performance. The project also incorporates Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) like Total Average Order Value (AOV) to provide a snapshot of the store's financial health and operational efficiency.

A profitability analysis identifies top-performing products based on profit margins, supporting strategic decisions around inventory management, pricing, and promotions. Interactive elements such as filters allow users to customize views, facilitating tailored analyses for diverse business needs.

To Summarize, this Tableau project transforms raw data into meaningful visualizations, enhancing understanding of key business metrics and empowering stakeholders to make informed decisions. The use of Tableau's interactive features ensures that the analysis is flexible and adaptable to changing business requirements, supporting the store's strategic objectives and growth ambitions.
